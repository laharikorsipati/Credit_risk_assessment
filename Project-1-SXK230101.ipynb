    "# Project 1 Starter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are some tips for submitting your project. You can use the points as partial check list before submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Give your notebook a clear and descriptive title.** \n",
    "- **Explain your work in Markdown cells.** This will make your notebook easier to read and understand. You can use different colors of font to highlight important points.\n",
    "- **Remove any unnecessary code or text.** For example, you should not include the template for training and scoring in your final submission.\n",
    "- **Package your submission in a single file.** I will deduct points for multiple files or incorrect folder structure.\n",
    "- **Name your notebooks correctly.** Include your name and Net-ID in the file name.\n",
    "- **Train your TE/WOE encoders on the training set only.** You can train them on the full dataset for your final model.\n",
    "- **Test your scoring function.** Most students scoring functions in the past din't work, so make sure to test yours before submitting your project.\n",
    "- **Avoid common mistakes in your scoring function.** For example, your scoring function should not:\n",
    "  - drop records, expect the target to be passed\n",
    "  - fit TE/WOE/Scalers\n",
    "  - return anything other than a Pandas DF.\n",
    "- **Make sure you have the required number of engineered features.** \n",
    "- **Don't create features and then not use them in the model**, if there is a reason not to use the feature in the model, explain.\n",
    "- **Don't include models in your notebook that you didn't train.** This is considered cheating and will result in a grade of zero for the project.\n",
    "- **Consistently display model performance metrics.** Use AUC or AUCPR for all models and iterations, and don't switch between metrics. For sure don't use accuracy, it is misleading metric for the imbalanced datasets. \n",
    "- **Discuss your model results in a Markdown cell.** Don't just print the results; explain what they mean.\n",
    "- **Include a conclusion section in your notebook.** This is your chance to summarize your findings and discuss the implications of your work.\n",
    "- **Treat your notebook like a project report that will be read by your manager who can't read Python code.** Make sure your notebook is clear, concise, and easy to understand.\n",
    "- **Display a preview of your dataset that you used for training.** This will help me understand what features you used in your model.\n",
    "- **Use the libraries versions specified on eLearning.** For example, you should use H2O 3.44.0.3  \n",
    "- **Use Python 3.10.11.** If you use another version and your code doesn't work on 3.10.11, it will be considered a bug in your code.\n",
    "- **When running H2O and want to suppress long prints (for example model summary), include \";\" at the end of the command.**\n",
    "- **Don't include the dataset with your deliverables.** "

Small businesses have been a primary source of job creation in the United States; therefore, fostering small business formation and growth has social benefits by creating job opportunities and reducing unemployment. There have been many success stories of start-ups receiving SBA loan guarantees such as FedEx and Apple Computer.

    "\n",
    "1. Retained_Created_Job_Ratio: This feature represents the ratio of retained jobs to created jobs. This can be an important indicator of the borrower's ability to sustain their business in the long run.\n",
    "2. Gauren_SBA_Appv: Its values are calculated by dividing the 'SBA_Appv' column (SBA’s guaranteed amount of approved loan) by 'GrAppv' column (gross amount approved by the lender) for each corresponding row. This ratio helps you analyze the extent to which the SBA is guaranteeing the loan relative to the total loan amount approved by the lender.\n",
    "3. Loan_Gross_Ratio: This feature represents the ratio of the loan amount to the gross disbursement. It can give an indication of the financial risk associated with the loan.\n",
    "4. SBA_Loan_Gross_Ratio: This feature represents the ratio of the SBA loan amount to the gross disbursement. It can give an indication of the SBA's involvement in the loan.\n",
    "5. EmployeesToLoanRatio:  its values are calculated by dividing the 'NoEmp' column (number of employees) by the 'SBA_Appv' column (approved SBA loan amount) for each corresponding row. This ratio can help you analyze the relationship between the number of employees and the size of the SBA loan approved for each entry in the dataset.\n",
    "6. LogDisbursementGross: This feature is a logarithmic transformation of the Disbursement Gross amount. This can help in handling the wide range of values and outliers in this feature.\n",
    "7. LogSBAApprovalAmount: This feature is a logarithmic transformation of the SBA Approval Amount. This can help in handling the wide range of values and outliers in this feature.\n",
    "8. BankOriginatedLoan: This feature indicates whether the loan was originated by the same bank as the borrower's bank state. A binary feature with value 1 for bank originated loans and 0 for other loans.\n",
    "9. LoanToIncomeRatio: This feature represents the loan amount to income ratio or disbursement amount per employees. It can give an indication of the borrower's ability to repay the loan.\n",
    "10.  TotalJobs variable which is an addition of Createjobs(New people recruited) and RetainedJob (workers working before)"
